# MFWM LateX equations

It's a Python script writen in Python3 and mainly tested on Linux.

The script find and write, in a Latex file, all the coupled equations of a MFWM.

All the equations used in the script are based from the papers ["Multiple Four-Wave Mixing in Optical Fibres"](https://doi.org/10.1109/ECOC.2014.6963922) ECOC 2014, Cannes - France  and ["Phase quadrature discrimination based on three-pump four-wave mixing in nonlinear optical fibers"](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.24.026930)
